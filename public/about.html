<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is P N Sri Harsha and I', pursuing my B.Tech in CSE with specialization in AI&ML.
I'm currently in my third year and I'm trying to upskill myself which is why I've taken up 
a web dev course in Udemy. I'm working on it daily learning html and other stuff, making
notes in my Notion for my daily revision. I'm also learning Python for ML alongside this 
which is currently my main domain. I'm looking forward to create interesting projects myself.</p>
